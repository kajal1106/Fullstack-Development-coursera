                <p>
            Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the userâ€™s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and
            orientation. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to
            accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.

                <h2><strong>RWD Media Queries</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.
                    The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices. 
                    Media queries can also be used to change layout of a page depending on the orientation of the browser.
                    It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.

                <h2><strong>Fluid Layout</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    A fluid layout is a type of webpage design in which layout of the page
                    resizes as the window size is changed. This is accomplished by defining areas of the page using percentages
                    instead of fixed pixel widths. The CSS used to create a fixed layout vs a fluid layout is shown below.
                    Fluid layouts solve this problem by using percentages to define each area of the layout.
